========

This checker is meant to be used with Vim plugin [vim-epitech](https://github.com/LeBarbu/vim-epitech) but can be used in CLI too.

## Installation

The easiest way is to download a precompiled binary [there](https://bintray.com/casimir/generic/epinorme/\_latestVersion).

Providing you have [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) and `$GOPATH/bin` in your path a simple `go get github.com/casimir/epinorme` will do the trick.
